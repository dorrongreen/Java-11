# Strive for Great Formatting

* Use auto format
* Google error messages
* Output values of variables
* Write code a little bit at a time, running frequently
* Write the end of a pair of brackets or quotes before filling them in
* Make sure you know what you're running!


## Source code
* Always type the code and experiment with it.
* Learn to touch type?
* Focus on practice, not memorization or notes.
